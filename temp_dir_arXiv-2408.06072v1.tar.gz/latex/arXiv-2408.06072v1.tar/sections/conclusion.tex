\section{Conclusion}

In this paper, we present CogVideoX, a state-of-the-art text-to-video diffusion model. 
It leverages a 3D VAE and an Expert Transformer architecture to generate coherent long-duration videos with significant motion. 
By implementing a comprehensive data processing pipeline and a video re-captioning method, we significantly improve the quality and semantic alignment of the generated videos. 
Our progressive training techniques, including mixed-duration training and resolution progressive training, further enhance the model's performance and stability. 
Our ongoing efforts focus on refining the \model's ability to capture complex dynamics and ensure even higher quality in video generation. 
We are also exploring the scaling laws of video generation models and aim to train larger and more powerful models to generate longer and higher-quality videos, pushing the boundaries of what is achievable in text-to-video generation.
