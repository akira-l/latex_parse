% \end{promptbox}
% \begin{promptbox}[Caption Generated by CogVLM2-Caption]
% \begin{verbatim}
% The video features a rugged coastline with cliffs descending 
% into the sea, where waves crash against rocks. A lighthouse 
% stands on a promontory, surrounded by greenery and bathed in
% sunlight that casts long shadows. The scene is tranquil yet 
% dynamic, with no human presence initially. As time passes, a 
% solitary house appears atop an elevated cliff, overlooking the 
% ocean. The landscape's colors transition from deep blues to 
% golden hues, suggesting dawn or dusk. Eventually, a road winds
% along the coast, leading to the secluded beach and lighthouse,
